  <section>The IHTSDO Workbench IDE Framework enables structured data checks to occurring concept
   creation, and at commit time. These data checks can be made optional, and only provide a warning
   message, or they can be made mandatory and the user will be unable to commit changes while a
   particular data check fails. </section>
  <section><xref href="#topic18/ad1003165" type="fig" format="dita"/> shows an example of data
   checks that have identified unedited default values that are currently uncommitted. These data
   check warnings are presented without the use of modal dialogs, and are therefore less intrusive
   to the user. At commit time, if the data checks have not been resolved, a modal dialog is
   presented to the user, and the commit is unable to continue.</section>
