  <title>Using the IHTSDO Workspace on Collabnet</title>

  <body>
    <section id="ay1069817">Collabnet is a web-based repository and framework
    for collaborative project development. Informatics Inc. have established (
    and manage ) a workspace for e-health projects that use the IHTSDO
    Workbench IDE and the distributed workflow environment enabled by the IDE.
    Development Organisations may chose to create and manage a project group
    within the IHTSDO Workspace, that gives its software developers access to
    a central source code repository (based on subversion). It also gives both
    the develÂ­opers and terminology modellers access to wiki-style project
    workspaces where project information can be managed, including issue
    management under various life-cycle phases. The key features and
    advantages of using Collabnet, both for IHTSDO Workbench terminology
    development and for extending the IHTSDO Toolkit components themselves,
    are discussed in <xref format="dita"
