      <p>Significant parts of this document were derived from "The ACE
      Guidebook", the operations guide for the ACE Toolkit developed by
      Informatics Inc.</p>

      <p>Some chapters have been automatically generated from Workbench
      application source and binary components - particularly those chapters
      documenting the Business Process Library and the Task Library.
      Consequently, their content may vary considerably from release to
      release.</p>
