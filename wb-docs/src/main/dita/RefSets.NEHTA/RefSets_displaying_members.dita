  <title>Displaying Refset Members in the Hierarchy List</title>
  <body>
   <section>The result of a specification refset is a member refset, i.e., the set of conÂ­cepts
    specified by the specification refset. IHTSDO Workbench can be set to display which concepts are
    members of a particular member refset.</section>
   <section>A diagonal paper clip icon <image href="../images/Refsets_Images/refsets_img_3.jpg"
     placement="inline" width="59" height="33"/> next to a concept means that the concept is a
    member of the specified refset. A horizontal paper clip icon next to a concept indicates that
    one or more of its children is a member of the refset. </section>
   <section>The display of these icons is enabled by dragging the desired member refset name onto
    the refset sub-tab, as shown in the previous section.</section>
