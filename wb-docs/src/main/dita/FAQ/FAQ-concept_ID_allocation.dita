    <p>SNOMED IDs are allocated by a class in dwfa-mojo
    (<codeph>org/dwfa/maven/transform/UuidSnomedMap</codeph>). They are
    allocated in sequence using an incremented number as well as the project
    code digits, namespace digits and the type digits (concept, description,
    relationship or subset) and finally the check sum digits.</p>

    <p>Allocated SNOMED IDs are stored in a mapping file in Subversion. This
    is a mapping from UUID to SNOMED ID. If no mapping exists for the UUID,
    then the SNOMED ID is generated.</p>

    <p>If a component had an associated SNOMED ID within the workbench (i.e.
    one that had been added via the import refset BP or manually using the
    component view), then this ID would be used instead of allocating a new
    SNOMED ID.</p>
