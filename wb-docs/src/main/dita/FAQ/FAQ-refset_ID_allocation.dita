    <section><title>At creation time or export?</title><p>The SNOMED IDs are
    allocated when one of the export mojos are executed. Currently, there are
    two export mojos â€“ rf2-export and subset-export, both located in
    dwfa-mojo. Both mojos reference the UUID to SNOMED ID map stored in
    Subversion, and will read/write to it as required.</p><p>An example
    project was set up that executes these two mojos on an older copy of the
    database:</p><codeblock>https://csfe.aceworkspace.net/svn/repos/dmd/branches/2009-04-01-trial- 1/dev/cfh_refset_release</codeblock><p>The
    idea is that the project could be run whenever a release was required, and
    at this point, the SNOMED IDs would be allocated and stored in Subversion.
    Subsequent executions of the release project would re-use the IDs
    allocated. The SNOMED IDs would appear in the release files (whether in
    rf2 or subset format).</p></section>
