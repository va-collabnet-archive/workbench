 <title>Build, Test and Publish Services Management—CollabNet CUBiT</title>
 <body>
  <section id="au1001166">IHTSDO Workbench uses CollabNet CUBiT<fn id="au1001800"> CUBiT is an
    acronym for Centralized Unified Build, Integration and Test.</fn><xref href="#topic6/au1001800"
    scope="local" type="fn" format="dita"/> to enable distributed development teams to quickly
   access a pool of on-demand build and test services. Teams can manage their own library of
   continuous build software stack profiles, rapidly provision that configuration onto an available
   machine, and version control the profile throughout development, build, and QA
    testing.<indexterm>CUBiT </indexterm></section>
  <section>CUBiT significantly reduces cost and time: Configuring servers for the code, build, and
   test cycle is 10 times faster, and teams save up to 90% of hard costs by centralizing development
   tool, server, and administrative infrastructure.</section>
  <section>Using CUBiT, teams can quickly configure test and build tools, stacks, and servers when
   they need them. They eliminate the time spent on configuring servers and save costs through
   optimizing servers across a global, distributed pool. Reuse of servers and profiles improves
   software quality while reducing administrative and hardware costs. Teams can use a standardized
   stack for their project and share across projects to eliminate up to 50 percent of the time spent
   on configuring servers.</section>
  <section>CUBiT provides a searchable build library for build results, artifacts, and components
   can be shared with others to support continuous integration. By providing access to and
   management of the global pool of servers, server use can be optimized and costs are controlled.
   CUBiT enables administrators to manage costs at each stage with comprehensive rollup reports by
   server, user, and project. Audit logs, dashboards, and reporting ensure traceability for
   governance and change management.</section>
  <section id="au1001206">CollabNet CUBiTenables development teams to access a global pool of
   on-demand code, build, and test services.CUBiT eases the server-intensive requirements of
   methodologies such as agile, scrum, branch based development, unit testing, and continuous
   integration. Development teams are able to accelerate development cycles, eliminate build and
   test errors, and gain flexibility in utilizing their machines - to more easily adapt their
   development environment to iterative and collaborative approaches.<indexterm>CollabNet

  <section id="au1001230">The IHTSDO workspace utilizes CUBiT to build the tools, documents, and the
   terminology release, and to publish the results of the build. This is accomplished through the
   use of several open source software products: Maven, Continuum, and Archiva.<indexterm>Maven

  <section id="au1001239">CollabNet CUBiT 2.0 benefits include self-service, dynamic allocation of
   development, build and test services that accelerate development with on-demand build and test
   tools, application stacks, and servers available. Developers can fulfill their own needs by
   drawing from a pool of standardized development, build, and test resources. You can further
   extend the pool of resources by building your own cloud with CollabNet, your own, or Amazon EC2
   cloud resources.<indexterm>CollabNet </indexterm></section>
  <section>Centralized management of builds and test software stacks translates to less time spent
   setting up and configuring systems. Version controlled software stack profiles are managed as a
   secure library for consistency across the development, build and test cycles. Project managers
   can create custom continuous integration profiles or choose from standards based on
   CruiseControl or Maven. Test tools profiles can also be created to meet custom
   requirements.</section>
  <section>CollabNet CUTiT 2.0 provides centralized management and reuse of build components,
   thereby eliminating productivity loss due to broken builds and errors from mis-configuration.
   Build processes are standardized with a library of build and test stacks. Continuous integration
   is made possible by automated end-to-end process and workflows. </section>
  <section>Project control across a global pool of computing resources, projects, profiles and
   build artifacts is facilitated with visibility into the continuous integration status. Access to
   software artifacts and hardware assets is secure and audit trails record each request. Projects
   costs of assets can be tracked from various clouds, and cost accounting of machine time for
   project and user reporting is also logged. Role-based permissions via CSFE control the level of
   each user’s access. </section>

  </section>
  <section id="au1001292">CollabNet CUBiT supports provisioning of Physical Hosts for Intel/AMC, Sun
   Sparc, VMware Server, VMware ESX, Solaris Containers, and hosts via API. Also supports Eclipse
   IDE integration, user virtualization management, cloud services for Amazon EC2 and CollabNet,
   private cloud management and cloud services via an API plus self-servicing, with on demand
    provisioning.<indexterm>CUBiT </indexterm></section>

   <title>Profile Library</title>
  </section>
  <section>Profiles can be selected, created and edited, permissions added and metadata attached.
   Also available is profile administration, version control, cost accounting for each profile.
   There is a centralized profile library management with automatic profile creation from an image
   snap shot.</section>
  <section id="au1001324">
   <title>Cost Accounting</title>
  </section>
  <section>Usage is tracked and accounted for based on software stack cost and CPU per hour
   cost.</section>

   <title>Reporting</title>
  </section>
  <section>Reporting includes download build logs and files, upload build logs and files,
