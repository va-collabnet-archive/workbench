/**
 * The representation of a single enactment of a process.
 * A process instance is created, managed and (eventually) 
 * terminated by a workflow management system, in accordance 
 * with the process definition.
 * 
 * Each process instance represents one individual enactment 
 * of the process, using its own process instance data, and 
 * which is (normally) capable of independent control and audit 
 * as it progresses towards completion or termination. It 
 * represents the unit of work with respect to a business process 
 * which passes through a workflow management system (for example, 
 * the processing of one insurance claim, or the production of one 
 * engineering design).
 * 
 * Each process instance exhibits internal state, which represents 
 * its progress towards completion and its status with respect to its 
 * constituent activities.
