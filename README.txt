Workbench Sample Project Assembly

The default build will produce a standalone editor (without documentation).
This is intended to be the fastest build.

You can optionally build the following profiles

  - sync: additionally builds the synchronized editor
  - viewer: additionally builds a viewer (NOT YET FUNCTIONAL)
  - documentation: builds the documentation and includes it in any produced editor or viewer
  - installer: builds installers for whichever editor(s) or viewer are produced
  - all: builds all 3 applications, with documentation and installers
