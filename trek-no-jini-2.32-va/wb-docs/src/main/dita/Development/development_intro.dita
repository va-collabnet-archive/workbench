    <section>This chapter is aimed at those software developers who intend to
    programatically extend an IHTSDO Workbench IDE ( e.g. editor of viewer ).
    Those considering to do so should be both proficient in the java
    programming language, and be well versed with the exisitng concepts and
    functionality described in this manual. Experience with automatic software
    build processes in a collaborative environment would also stand the
    prospective developer in good stead. This, and the following chapters
    which constitute the Developers Guide, are only intended to be sufficient
    in detail to guide prospective developers, rather than be a comprehensive
    developersâ€™ resource. Those wishing to embark on extending the
    functionality of IHTSDO Workbench are advised to peruse the available
    source code and discuss their proposed changes or enhancements with those
    in the international community who have trodden a similar path before
    them.</section>
