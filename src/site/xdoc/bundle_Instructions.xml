    <section name="Introduction">
      <p>The instructions below describe how to install and build an ACE Bundle. There are two .zip files:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>snomed-ct-bundle.zip - contains 1 version of SNOMED</li>
        <li>bundle-ace.zip - contains 8 versions of SNOMED</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Assumptions</h3>
        <p>These instructions assume that you are able to build at least one ACE Workspace project. 
          That maven 2.06 and java 1.6 are installed, that you have at least 2gig of RAM,
        and at least 7 gig of harddisk space.</p>   
      <h3>Instructions for snomed-ct-bundle - one version of SNOMED</h3>
 
      <ol>
        <li>Unzip snomed-ct-bundle.zip where you would like to store it. </li>
        <li>A directory called "snomed-ct-bundle" will be created. This directory will contain a "pom.xml" file, and a "src" directory. </li>
        <li>Launch a terminal window and change directory to snomed-ct-bundle directory.</li>
        <li>Enter: mvn --version - this will ensure that maven is installed.</li>
        <li>Enter: mvn clean install - this step might take a while to download everything depending upon your network speed.</li>
        <li>Upon successful completion of the previous step a "target" directory is created.</li>
        <li>Before launching ace you will need to install the "jsk-policy-2.1.jar into your jre's extension folder. 
          The jsk-policy-2.1.jar file can be found in the "lib-ext" directory of your bundle. On windows, this is located in the \lib\ext of your folder. 
          For example C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_02\lib\ext.</li>
        <li>Change directory to the "target\snomed-ct-bundle.dir" depending on your operating system execute one of the following: startAce.bat, 
          startAceOsX.sh, startAceLinux.sh</li>
        <li>You will be asked to login - Select the user profile for "bootstrap.ace". There is no password - hit "ok".</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Instructions for bundle-ace - 8 versions of SNOMED</h3>
   
      <ol>
        <li>Unzip bundle-ace.zip where you would like to store it. </li>
        <li>A directory called "bundle-ace" will be created. This directory will contain a "pom.xml" file, and a "src" directory. </li>
        <li>Launch a terminal window and change directory to bundle-ace directory.</li>
        <li>Enter: mvn --version - this will ensure that maven is installed.</li>
        <li>Enter: mvn clean install - this step might take several hours to download everything depending upon your network speed.</li>
        <li>Upon successful completion of the previous step a "target" directory is created.</li>
        <li>Before launching ace you will need to install the "jsk-policy-2.1.jar into your jre's extension folder. 
          The jsk-policy-2.1.jar file can be found in the "lib-ext" directory of your bundle. On windows, this is located in the \lib\ext of your folder.
