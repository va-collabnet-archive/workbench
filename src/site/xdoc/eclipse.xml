    <section name="Eclipse Integration">
       <p>Eclipse provides a generally available integrated development environment for developing java components. 
       <a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-eclipse-plugin/overview.html">The Maven Eclipse Plugin</a> provides a means to 
       generate an Eclipse project file from a Maven project.</p>
       <p>The DWFA modules include an entry for the Maven Eclipse Plugin in each of their <code>pom.xml</code> files.
       If you would like to use Eclipse to extend the DWFA environment by adding your own tasks, please follow these steps:</p>
       <ol>
        <li><p>Eclipse needs to know the path to the local maven repository. 
                Therefore the classpath variable <i>M2_REPO</i> has to be set. 
                Execute the following command:</p>
                <p><code>
                    mvn -Declipse.workspace=&lt;path-to-eclipse-workspace&gt; eclipse:add-maven-repo 
                    </code></p>
            <p>You can also define a new classpath variable inside eclipse: 
            From the menu bar, select Window &gt; Preferences. Select the Java &gt; Build Path &gt; Classpath Variables page.</p></li>
        <li>Navigate to the <code>dev/process</code> directory inside dfwa folder you installed with the installer, or you copied from a CD-ROM.<br/><br/></li>
        <li>Verify that you are in the same directory as the pom.xml file<br/><br/></li>
        <li>Execute <code>mvn eclipse:eclipse</code> at a command prompt from within this folder. This execution will cause maven to generate
            several files used by eclipse. Eclipse can now import the module. <br/><br/></li>
        <li>Import the process project. From the menu bar, select File &gt; Import... From the import dialog, select General &gt; Existing Projects into Workspace,
        then select the Next  &gt; button. Select the Browse button next to the Select root directory, and navigate to the <code>dev/process</code> 
        directory inside dfwa folder you installed with the installer, or you copied from a CD-ROM, and select this folder. The project name will show
        inside the Projects: list inside the import dialog. Select the finish button, and the project will be imported. You can now browse the source files, and other
        files inside this project from within Eclipse. <br/><br/></li>
       </ol>
