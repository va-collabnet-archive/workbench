    EXAMPLE - The following is an example of the string 
              representation of a UUID as a URN:
    	urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6
    	
    	NOTE - An alternative URN format (see [6]) is available, 
    	but is not recommended for URNs generated using UUIDs. This
    	alternative format uses the single integer value of the UUID 
    	specified in 6.3, and represents the above example as
    	
    	"urn:oid:2.25.329800735698586629295641978511506172918".
