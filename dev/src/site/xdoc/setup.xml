    <p>Subsequent exercises depend on a health record. This exercise shows the steps
    necessary to install a pre-generated record on the chart server.</p>
    <ol>
       <li>Select the Queue Viewer window.</li>
       <li>In the queue list on the 
       left hand side of the window, select the queue with the 
       "Queue Name" of "[prefix] Clinic Launcher Queue." Once selected, 
       the processes within this queue are listed in a table to the top and right of the queue list.</li>
       <li>Select the process with the name "Put Chart on Server" from the process list. Once selected, 
       the process is shown on the panel below. This particular process has four tasks, that are briefly described here: 
       <ul>
        <li>
            <dl>
                <dt><font color='black'>Change Instance Id</font></dt>
                <dd>Changes the identifier of the process when launched to ensure that all processes have unique identifiers.</dd>
            </dl>
        </li>
        <li>
            <dl>
                <dt><font color='green'>Set Deadline</font></dt>
                <dd>Sets the execution deadline to be 0 minutes relative to the time this task is executed. This
        is used to order processes within a queue to ensure timely execution.</dd>
            </dl>
        </li>
        <li>
            <dl>
                <dt><font color='green'>Put Chart On Server</font></dt>
                <dd>Prompts the user to select a chart object from the filesystem that will be put
        on the chart server for subsequent exercises.</dd>
            </dl>
        </li>
        <li>
            <dl>
                <dt><font color='red'>Process Complete</font></dt>
                <dd>Indicates that the process has completed normally.</dd>
            </dl>
        </li>
       </ul>
     </li>
     <li>Select the "execute" button on the bottom right side of the window. </li>
     <li>Using the file dialog box, select the file "ChekovRecord.bean" located in [install directory]/beans/records/ChekovRecord.bean on unix or 
     [install directory]\beans\records\ChekovRecord.bean on window. </li>
     <li>Note that after execution, the process list refreshes, and shows all the processes available in this queue. Since this queue is configured
     to be a "launcher" queue, the process remains in the queue so it can be lauched again. In most other queues, launching a process removes that process
     from the queue. </li>
