About the Project Module Pictures

 The project pictures are intended to give each module a unique look to help with navigation. They 
 where selected from royalty free sources, and have no particular significance, other than
 being unique for each module. 
 
 Contributions of new project pictures that may be more linked to the theme of a project
 are welcome.
