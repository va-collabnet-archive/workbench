/**
 * Interface for tasks which are contained within business processes. Execution of tasks
 * are done in two steps. First the evaluate method is called to do most of the activity of 
 * this task, then the complete method is called to perform any final functions such as writing
 * the process to a serialized stream. The complete action cannot make any changes to the 
 * evaluate method must provide all the information necessary for the process to determine the 
 * next task before calling the complete method. This seperation is necessary so that if the
 * task is serialized by a process during the complete step, the proper state will be represented 
 * when the process is deserialized.
